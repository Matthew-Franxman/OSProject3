# OSProject3
This is the repo for OS Project 3 between Matthew Franxman and Thomas Cheal

Thomas below I will add steps to teach you how to get this repo off the ground and running.

First I think you should take a l;ook at this website for basic git commands:
https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/basic-git-commands-776639767.html

Secondly here are the steps that you need to do to make this work:
1. Make sure you have git installed in your terminal (pretty sure it is but just use the snap command to install if not)
2. Once you have done that, go to the main page and find the green code button on the right, then calling 'git clone xxxxxxxxx' where that is the copy and pasted name of the repo
3. When working locally, pull down the master branch, however always work on your own branch. This means that you need to start by pulling down master and then creating a new branch off of master. NEVER PUSH ANYTHING UP TO MASTER UNLESS YOU GO THROUGH ME AND VICE VERSA. IT CAN SERIOUSLY MESS UP OUR REPO.
4. The command for making your own branch ios in the cheat sheet, however i think its 'git branch -b xxxxxxxx'
5. To push up to github you will need to run 'git add .' and then 'git commit -m "PUT A MESSAGE IN HERE"'
6. To push it up, run 'git push origin xxxxxxxxx' where x is your branch's name.
7. It SHOULD push up, and then you will need to mereg it into master, but I can handle that for now!

If you have any questions about any of this, PLEASE let me know ASAP
